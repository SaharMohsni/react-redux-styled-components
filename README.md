## Reflection

This was a 2 days long project built during my technical test for the Front-End Developer position. Project goals development of a single page responsive application using react javascript, redux-saga, styled components and Material UI. The design of the page was a simple idea by me ( no mok-up provided) and for sure need to be optimized.  

The main role of this application is being a helper for the cocktail bar owber to get the most cocktails wanted by clients. It allow users to create their own cocktail depending on their needs. So they can make different combination of ingridents, category, glasses and alcohol type to get the mix result. I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `redux-saga` and other dependances needed.  

One of the main challenges I ran into was is to work on this just in two days and without mok-up that can clear my vison while coding ( weekend). 

Because i needed to deliver the project i tried to make the project work but it still need more improvement on the UI side. I will considered adding a test process is a future feature that can be added beside the UI improvement.

Managing time was my biggest challenge in this project because I needed to finish this time just in 2 days.

At the end of the project, the technologies implemented was `javascript`, `React`, `Redux-saga`, `Material UI`, `styled components`, and a significant amount of VanillaJS and CSS for the front-end part. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.


In the next iteration the front-end part could be optimized on different devices and the application will became better after adding the unit tests and fixing the problems that will be detected.
